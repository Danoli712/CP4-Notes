		<p> The Ferrari 250 GTO is a GT car produced by Ferrari from 1962 to 1964 for homologation into the FIA's Group 3 Grand Touring Car category. 
			It was powered by Ferrari's Tipo 168/62 V12 engine. The "250" in its name denotes the displacement in cubic centimeters of each of its cylinders; 
			"GTO" stands for "Gran Turismo Omologato", Italian for "Grand Touring Homologated." Just 36 250 GTOs were manufactured between 1962 and 1964. 
			This includes 33 cars with 1962-63 bodywork (Series I), three with 1964 (Series II) bodywork similar to the Ferrari 250 LM. Four of the older 1962-1963 
			(Series I) cars were updated in 1964 with Series II bodies. When new, the GTO cost $18,000 in the United States, with buyers personally approved by 
			Enzo Ferrari and his dealer for North America, Luigi Chinetti. In May 2012 the 1962 250 GTO made for Stirling Moss set an all-time record selling price 
			of $38,115,000. In October 2013, Connecticut-based collector Paul Pappalardo sold chassis number 5111GT to an unnamed buyer for a new record of 
			around $52 million. </p> <!--Plain old text -->
