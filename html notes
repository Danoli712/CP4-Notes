			< h 1 > and < / h 1> makes a header <br /> 
			always start the start of an html document with < !DOCTYPE html > so the computer knows its in html <br />
			Html structure (the sandwich that surrounds it) is: <br />
			< h t m l > <br />
			< / h t m l >  <br />
			writing < p > and < / p > are tags that are for making paragraphs <br />
			surrounding a phrase with < h e a d > and < / h e a d > will not make the phrase appear on the page like code <br />
			surrounding a phrase with < t i t l e > and < / t i t l e > will give your web page a title. <br /> 
			"Head" is what you cant see and adding "body" tags will make taext that you can see <br /> 
			< b r  / > will break the line. you can add it anywhere you like.<br />
			you can write comments by placing them between < ! - - and - - >
